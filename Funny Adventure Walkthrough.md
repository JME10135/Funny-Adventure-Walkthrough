This is a medal walkthrough for Funny Adventure by BlahBlah508 on Newgrounds. You can play it [here](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/659880).

To avoid spoilers for those who are stuck but still want to figure out the puzzles on their own, this walkthrough uses the expand/collapse text element. Click on an arrow to get one hint at a time.

WARNING: Pressing tab at any time during the game takes you back to the main menu and you will need to start over!
<details>
<summary>Bosses</summary>

- At the end of each chapter there is a boss fight. They all work the same. Wait for the red orb to appear and then hover over it with your mouse. Remember that you only deal damage when you *enter* the hitbox. No need to click. A good strategy is usually to follow the orb slightly at the edge of it and hope to get many hits in a row.

- <details><summary>You can cheat them...</summary>

  - ...by holding down the mouse button to prevent yourself from getting hit. You still need to release to be able to damage the bosses though.

  - Click the green dot when the bomb reaches zero. Sometimes it is not visible and I guess it is behind the bomb then. Fast reaction is the key.
  </details>
  
- <details><summary>Stage 9-10</summary>

  - This boss requires some fancy moves and agility. It is always shooting arrows in the same spiral, so try to follow the flow of arrows on the inside if possible. Otherwise just try to get through the gaps of it.

- <details><summary>Stage 10-10</summary>

  - Stay at the middle of the left edge the first two attacks, then at the bottom to the left the last two attacks.
  </details>
  
- <details><summary>Stage 10-11</summary>

  - WARNING: A little spoiler for the bad ending could be worth mentioning. If you wait for long enough after you have depleted the shield completely, you get the bad ending and have to play the whole game again for another try.

  - <details><summary>Final boss battle (shield part)</summary>

    - Avoid the red shuriken-like projectiles and wait at the middle of the bottom for the red walls to trap you and force you upwards. There is no red orb. To deplete the shield you need to move the cursor forth and back between the number for how much shield it is left and the actual shield. It works best if you move the mouse horizontally in the middle of the screen at that height. **You can only deplete the shield between the secont and the third shuriken attack.** Stay in the middle during the second attack so you are ready.
   
    - If you have not used the click-and-hold-down cheat yet it could be time to make an exception.
    </details>

  - After you have taken down the shield there are differend outcomes for what you do, not do and have done through the game. It's all covered in the endings part below.

<details>
<summary>Endings</summary>

- <details><summary>The first ending</summary>

  - You get this if the final boss manages to escape after you have depleted the shield completely.

  - <details><summary>The second ending</summary>
 
    - Click the bow and arrow for the ultimate attack and defeat the boss. The second ending is for not having all 5 puzzle pieces.

    - <details><summary>The third ending</summary>

      - The rest of the endings are for defeating the boss and having all 5 puzzle pieces. For the third ending, enter the wrong code.

      - <details><summary>The fourth ending</summary>

        - The fourth ending is for entering the correct code. Sadly, you cannot see the puzzle pieces in-game other than when you collect them which makes this much harder.

        - <details><summary>Here are all the pieces</summary>
